- [x] re-ordering
    - [x] drag and drop

## required tweaks

## ideas

- batch input
- refactor - separate dom & logic
- wrap lines for very long tasks
- enter multi-line tasks?

- escape -> exits edit mode without altering task
- enter -> with no change, exits edit mode

- hotkeys
- keyboard navigation/selectable tasks

- migrate to indexDB for storing data?
